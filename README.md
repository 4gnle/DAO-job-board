## The motive
Several people in the DAO have discussed how finding a DAO that they can contribute to has been a pain in the butt. This project aims to create a bridge between the talent & DAOs looking for talent.

## What has been proposed
- `eknobl` has proposed that we should have a group of people from the DAO who should try & make contacts with other DAOs.
- `jgonz.eth` from a DAO called `DAOists` has proposed a collabaration between Developer DAO and DAOists. [Link to their message](https://discord.com/channels/883478451850473483/888867921089138729/892046468121264198)

## What has been done 
- `kempsterrr` and `with-heart` have joined the DAOists' discord server to start talking about a possible collabaration.
- A placeholder repo has been created with some basic documentation to get the ball rolling.

## What needs to be done next
- [ ] We need to talk & connect with more and more DAOs to try to better understand how DAOs recruit.
- [ ] An MVP for the actual job board needs to be developed so that we can get people to try it, get feedback & iterate.

## We need volunteers for:
- **Communication** — We need some people who can reach out to other DAOs; understand how they recruit talent and/or talk about a possible collabaration. 
- **Development** — We need developers to start working on the MVP. We haven't doubled down on a tech stack yet. (We might even use a no-code solution for an MVP)
